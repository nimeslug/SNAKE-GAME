# SNAKE-GAME
This is a simple Snake Game built with HTML and embedded JavaScript.
The game features a grid with a size of 30, where the player controls a snake that moves around to eat apples, grow longer, and avoid hitting itself.
The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) using the arrow keys.
The game area is displayed on a canvas, and the snake's body is represented by a trail of segments. If the snake collides with itself, it resets to its original size.
The apple appears at random locations, and each time the snake eats one, it grows longer.
The game has a classic retro feel, with the snake's movement wrapping around the screen when it reaches the edges.
